# NFL-Project-Proposal

In this final project, we introduce a interactive platform we built using R. The Shiny application we built can be seen [here](LINK.com), or directly from this link: `https://USERNAME.shinyapps.io/PROJECT-NAME/`.

## Components of our Application

### Visual Representation
Within our application, we created a scatterplot and a map. These visual representations can be manipulated using widgets. 

#### Scatterplot
Our Shiny application includes a scatterplot of the statistics for a particular football position over the years 1985-2015. 

#### Map
Our Shiny application also includes a map of all colleges in the United States that have players drafted to the NFL from 2000 - 2015. Our aim was to see visible differences in which colleges showed up when we filtered our data by different factors. These factors included the range of rounds picked, the range of years picked, and the position players were getting drafted for.
